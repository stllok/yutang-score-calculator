## Requirements

## Background

Since the *Yutang Cup* uses special rules to calculate team scores, this tool is designed to display the scores on live streams instantly.

As stated on the forum page, the *Yutang Cup* put your score to the opponent team's and checks the rankings to allocate scores. It's frustrating to count scores manually (especially FreeMod with the EASY mod, which is a NIGHTMARE). [Current tools](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/462263-osu-yutangcups7-calculator) do not cover the FreeMod multiplier. Also, they are only used on the multiplayer history page by referees.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Handle FreeMod EASY multiplier
- [x] Improve UI (maybe)
