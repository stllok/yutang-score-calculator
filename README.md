# Live Stream Calculator for Yutang Cup

## Requirements
- [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory)

## Background

Since the *Yutang Cup* uses special rules to calculate team scores, this tool is designed to display the scores on live streams instantly.

As stated on the forum page, the *Yutang Cup* put your score to the opponent team's and checks the rankings to allocate scores. It's frustrating to count scores manually (especially FreeMod with the EASY mod, which is a NIGHTMARE). [Current tools](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/462263-osu-yutangcups7-calculator) ~~do not cover the FreeMod multiplier~~ I updated the multiplier on the [new script](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1114090891087462511/1233783631021871134/Osu_YutangCupS8_Calculator-1.5.user.js?ex=6636430c&is=6634f18c&hm=2700968b9f833846e58e3e7eadb91772ac79baa791a3db5b2057131ad19fc995&) as request. Also, they are only used on the multiplayer history page by referees.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Handle FreeMod EASY multiplier
- [x] Improve UI (maybe)
